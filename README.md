Python asyncio is a module that provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives. Here are some of the key asyncio functions along with simple definitions of their purposes:

    asyncio.create_task(coroutine): This function is used to create a Task object to run the given coroutine. It allows you to schedule the execution of a coroutine concurrently with other tasks.

    asyncio.run(main, *, debug=False): The entry point to run the main coroutine, typically used in scripts. It sets up the event loop, runs the main coroutine until it completes, and then closes the event loop.

    asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None): A coroutine that suspends execution for the given delay (in seconds) before continuing.

    asyncio.wait(tasks, *, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED): Waits for the given coroutines (tasks) to complete, with options for waiting until all tasks are done or any single task is done.

    asyncio.gather(*coroutines_or_futures, loop=None, return_exceptions=False): Gathers multiple coroutines or Future objects into a single awaitable object, allowing you to execute them concurrently and collect their results.

    asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None): Waits for the result of an awaitable object (coroutine or Future) with a specified timeout. If the awaitable doesn't complete within the timeout, a TimeoutError is raised.

    asyncio.shield(aw): Wraps an awaitable object (coroutine or Future) to prevent cancellation. It ensures that the wrapped awaitable is always executed even if cancellation is requested elsewhere.
